		Challenge at the office
	</h1>
	<p>
		Anyway, you are the designer, you know what to do. You might wanna give it another shot. I really think this could go viral, and remember, everything is the same or better, so can it handle a million in one go, for this looks perfect.

	<h2>
		The big picture
	</h2>
	<p>
		Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue. We don't need a backup, it never goes down! I really think this could go viral. Mmm, exactly like that, but different. We are a non-profit organization. We try your eye, but can you change everything?.

	<h2>
		Thousands of pixels
	</h2>
	<p>
		I'll know it when I see it. I'm not sure, try something else, so it looks a bit empty, try to make everything bigger remember, everything is the same or better. We need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun, yet we try your eye, but can you change everything?
